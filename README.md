# CSCI-B 659 Reinforcement Learning
A Phd level course at Indiana University by professor [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/) following the reputed Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction book book closely. 
  
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments in the course. This assignments consist of 2 parts. 1) Mathematical derivations and theoretical from the book and 2) Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms from scratch in C programming language using a simplified RL Glue framework. Both of the sections are very challenging. Especially programming assignemnts in C, where debugging elusive Reinforcement Learning programs is a nightmare.
